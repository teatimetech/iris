## Next steps prompts (12/13/2025):
1. Review the attached DevOps and CI/CD best practices document, and this projects structure, design, modules, etc, and add a modern CI/CD pipeline (as a k8s cluster) that does CI builds, notifications, etc, based on code checkins, and runs the CD process with modern best-practice workflows. All parallel environments as their own K8S clusters - and promote to production K8S cluster as the CD workflow qualifies it. Leverage GitHub Actions + Argo CD for CI/CD. Incorporate modern best practices and architecture for CI/CD pipelines and Development environments, including artifactory and registry for artifacts, LLMs, libraries, and images, and vault for secrets. Refactor/Modify the codebase to be more modern and align with industry best practices where necessary to implement the above changes. Test everything to ensure it works as expected. Document everything in a DevOps and CI/CD README document. 

2. Based on industry best practices, What are the scenarios for using local vault vs. env injection for managing secrets, and how do we implement that in a developer environment? What kid of secrets do we store in a valut vs. env variables? How do we handle secrets in a production environment?
